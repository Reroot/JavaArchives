Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not 
start with vowels. Your result cannot contain 
duplicates.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

TABEL __Station__
Field - Type
ID    - VARCHAR2(21)
STATE - VARCHAR(2)
LAT_L - NUMBER
LONG_W  - LONG_W

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[^aeiou]';

select DISTINCT city 
from STATION 
where city 
NOT REGEXP '[aeiou]$' 


//NOT//NOT, but both work
Putting a ^ inside the closed bracket means something 
completely different than putting it outside the 
brackets. Putting it inside the brackets makes it 
match all characters EXCEPT the ones inside the bracket. 
So instead of writing [bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz], 
we can write [^aeiou]
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY,0,1)) 
NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
**WHEN IT"S AT THE END**

select DISTINCT city from STATION where city 
NOT REGEXP '[aeiou]$' 

**WHEN IT"S OR BOTH**

select distinct CITY 
from STATION 
where CITY 
not regexp '^[auoie].*[aouie]$' 
order by CITY;

select distinct CITY 
from STATION 
where CITY 
not regexp '^[aeiou]' 
OR CITY 
not regexp '[aeiou]$' 
order by CITY;

**CHANGE OR TO AND*** FRONT AND BACK NOT AEIOU

select distinct CITY 
select distinct CITY 
from STATION
where CITY
not REGEXP '^[aeiou]'
AND CITY 
not REGEXP '[aeiou]$'
ORDER BY CITY;
